# matchbreaker-dating

This project was a dive into ruby on rails, using it for the front and backend of a basic site. The fluff concept is a dating themed site where you scroll through a list of people to find someone who's your type and combat them to the death.



- This site features account authentication, allowing you to make an account and log in and out.
- When logged in, you see the whole pool of users listed on the landing page. You can then choose one and initiate a duel, and set their status to deceased an send them to the graveyard.
- The site also has a random item generator that will create items with randomized stats that users can take.
